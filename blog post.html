        <div class="p"> <p class="text1">Romeo once said that “a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet,<br>
         and while  his love-blindness may have hindered his fashion eye, he makes a good point.<br> Plus, we’re a sucker 
        for a romantic declaration. You see, a fashion icon is less about the <br>title and more about the ingrained 
        sartorial approach and influence a person carries.<br> For instance, though Anna Wintour is widely considered 
        to be the face of the fashion world <br>(read all about the esteemed editor-in-chief in our biography review),
         with her golden touch <br> influencing designers and editors alike,she is not a fashion icon; she’s an 
         icon within the bubble<br> of fashion. Her uniform of printed midi-dresses, knee-high boots,and 
         Chanel sunglasses,<br> has situated the Condé Nast leader firmly amongst the stylish elite,
         but she has not yet become <br>a style maverick—that’s right, there’s still time.
        <br> 
        To be considered a fashion icon, your style must either create cultural conversation,<br> have trend-worthy appeal, or most commonly, outlive you. 
        If you have all three you <br>become a fashion triple threat, soon to be encapsulated in Pinterest boards and<br> rewarded with retweets for eternities to come.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="/assessts/images/image2.jpg" alt="What Is Fashionicon?"> </div> 
<div class="p"> <p class="text2">The singer, designer, and melting pot of multi-hyphenates is a fashion icon simply because she has<br> put in the work, work, work, work (sorry, it was right there). From her baggy jeans and crop-top outfits,<br> which dominated the noughties, to her confident modern-day aesthetic, Rihanna’s style trajectory is one <br>for the history books. Her affinity for sporting cult designers before they turn mainstream (see Molly <br>Goddard) and spotting trends in advance have cemented her icon status and enabled her to cultivate<br> her own fashion empire: Fenty.</p>

<div class="p"> <p class="text3">As the youngest on our list, Zendaya (26) shows that you don’t need age on your side <br> to become a fashion icon—you just need to make decisive style choices.  Hailing from <br> the halls of Disney Studios, the young star’s initial fashion approach was what you’d <br> expect, a mismatch of colorful layers and sneakers. However, after meeting stylist Law<br>  Roach, everything changed. The young star exchanged her pragmatic “girl next door”<br>  image for a more purposeful approach, donning designers that would garner attention <br> from best-dressed lists and would give her the freedom to carve a different fashion path—one<br>  where she looks equally as elegant in a men’s Berluti suit as she does in a silk Vera Wang gown.</p>
